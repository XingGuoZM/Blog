Unlike other widely used JavaScript frameworks, Vue.js is both simple and lightweight. But it comes with many features that enable users to build modern and interactive web interfaces rapidly. It further enables developers to build a variety of web interfaces simply with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design of Vue.js is influenced by several JavaScript front-end frameworks including AngularJS and ReactJS. However, VueJS still differs from other JavaScript frameworks in terms of features and functionalities.
## Overview of Important Features of Vue.js
### Adoptable Stack
As mentioned earlier, Vue.js is a simple and lightweight JavaScript framework. It is designed with features to simplify development of web user interfaces. Its core library focuses exclusively on the view layer of the web application. Also, Vue.js features a minimal core along with an adoptable stack. The adoptable stack enables Vue to meet the requirements of small, medium, and large web applications. Also, the developers can easily extend Vue.js by integrating it with other libraries and projects.

### HTML-based Template Syntax
Unlike other frameworks, Vue.js enables developers to build web user interfaces by combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It further features HTML-based template syntax to simplify the process of binding the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue data instance. Each DOM template can also be executed by the web browsers as valid HTML. Also, it can be compiled into virtual DOM render functions to make the components of web user interface render dynamically.
### Components
Like other modern JavaScript frameworks, Vue also features a component-based system. Each Vue component is designed as a small and reusable part of the user interface. But the components provided by Vue are browser-independent. So the developers can implement the components in a straightforward way, without worrying about browser-wide implementation.

### Reactive Variables
Vue.js enables web developers to take advantage of reactive variables. The programmers have option to observe the variables as well as add watchers to the variables. These reactive variables further keep their peers informed about all changes and updates. Hence, each time the variables are modified, the view is updated automatically. The feature further makes it easier for developers to manage state. But the process initially requires additional time and resources.

### Custom Directives
In addition to providing a set of default directives, Vue.je further allows JavaScript programmers to create and register custom directives. Hence, the web developers can accomplish a variety of tasks by registering custom directives. For instance, they can register custom directives to implement low level DOM access on plan elements. However, Vue.js 2.0 requires developers to reuse and abstract code only through components.

### Innovative Virtual DOM Implementation
Along with being leaner and faster than its predecessor, Vue.js 2.0 further supports virtual DOM implementation in a manner similar to React.js. The components in Vue have the capability to keep track of their dependencies at the time of rendition. Thus, the system can easily decide when to render a component again and which component to render again based its dependencies. Vue.js 2.0 further optimizes virtual DOM implementation by detecting names and attributes of static classes, and maximum static sub trees.

### Streaming Server Side Rendering
In addition to supporting Virtual DOM, Vue.js 2.0 also implements streaming server-side rendering in an innovative way. Unlike React, Vue.js does not implement server-side rendering synchronously. Hence, the chances of blocking the server’s event loop and increasing the time-to-content on the client are eliminated completely. The developers can further avail the built-in streaming server-side rendering provided by Vue.js 2.0 to make the web server more responsive and render content to users without any interruption and delay.

### Several Libraries and Plug-ins
Vue.js makes it easier for programmers to accomplish common tasks by providing default libraries and plug-ins for routing, Ajax, UI components, validation, and state management. At the same time, the framework also allows web developers to write and use their own custom plug-ins. Hence, they can create custom plug-ins to add global-level functionality to the framework. For instance, the programmers can add one or more global assets to Vue.js through vue-touch. Likewise, they can use vue-element to add global methods and properties to the framework. The developers can further write custom plug-ins to extend Vue.js according to the specific needs of each project.

### Unit Testing
Vue.js allows developers to assess the quality of the user interface and its components by performing unit testing. It further allows developers to create testable components. The developers can also perform unit testing efficiently by using tools like Browserify or Webpack. However, they have to configure the testing tools properly to execute unit tests at frequent intervals.

Vue.js is both open source and free. But the framework has been evolving consistently to meet the emerging trends in user interface development. For instance, Vue.js 2.0 comes with several new features to make the web server deliver content to users in a faster and more efficient way. The developers can always use the latest version of Vue.js to take advantage of several new features and advanced front-end development tools.
